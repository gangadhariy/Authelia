<h1 align="center">Authelia Deployment on Kubernetes</h1>

Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server that provides two-factor authentication, single sign-on (SSO), and access control to your applications. This guide covers the steps to deploy Authelia on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

Authelia supports multiple backend storage solutions like PostgreSQL and Redis, and can be integrated with external services for session management and access control.

This document outlines how to set up Authelia in a Kubernetes environment, configure its services, and expose it using Ingress.
